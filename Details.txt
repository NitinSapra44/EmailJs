Hi,In this project we are using emailjs to send automatic mails.In this case we only need a frontend i.e no backend is required
for using this service.
Firstly to get started we will use the command "npm install npm install @emailjs/browser" this will install all the required
dependencies required.
we will visit the emailjs website to register our email service we will use to make things happen.
we need three things from that website a."service id" b."Templete id" c."Public key".
These 3 are the only things we need to generate automatic emails.
now in case of templates we need to style them using html.

Since we are using "name = user_name " to get user input we can access these values in email using {{user_name}} so we will use that
accordingly.

Here we are using useRef hook from react to get user values in our app that will be sent to my emailjs api.
